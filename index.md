# SDEs and Diffusion Models - Kieran Didi and Francisco Vargas, R255 module Cambridge University, Lent 2024

Hey everyone! This is a course about the theory of SDEs and how it can be applied to diffusion models. We will introduce the foundations of Ito Calculus and apply them to diffusion processes within generative modelling, sampling and data assimilation.

The modules in this course are the following:

| Topic 	| Content                         	|
|------	|--------------------------------	|
| 1    	| Measure Theory for Probability, Ito Integrals, Martingales                   	|
| 2    	| Forward (FPK) and Backward Kolmogorov Equations, Infinitesimal Generator                          	|
| 3    	| Ito's Lemma 	|
| 4    	| Linear SDEs and the OU process  	|
| 5    	| Time reversal               	|
| 6    	| Doob's h-transform and conditioning SDEs                  	|
| 7    	| Girsanov's Theorem, KL divergence in path space                  	|
| 8    	| Half Bridges and Stochastic Control                         	|
| 9    	| Feynman-Kac Formula and the path integral                      	| 
| 10   	| Schroedinger Bridges             	| 

These topics will be covered in X sessions. While the first session will be just us lecturing, the rest of the sessions will be lecturing in the first half and students presenting papers in the second half. You will present the following papers (30 minutes each):
